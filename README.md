### Introduction

Cellular Conquest was a game I built for a friend's Connecticut Science Center exhibit. It was my first experience using `pygame`.

The main goal of the game is to protect your <img src="res/cell.png" alt = "cell" width="48"> cell from <img src = "res/virus.png" alt = "virus" width = "48"> viruses.
